summary: "Economies across the globe face a double-headed threat: record levels of unemployment and towering public debt. Over the past two years, many western governments' response to one has come at the cost of the other; furlough schemes and stimulus cheques have left government balance sheets looking worryingly red. It’s time to take a more aggressive approach. Only one activity raises tax revenue whilst also providing jobs: entrepreneurship. Yet the job of nurturing talent and spotting business potential shouldn’t be left to a handful of venture capitalists (VCs) and angel investors. Unemployment and sky-rocketing debt is a government problem; it therefore requires a government solution."
