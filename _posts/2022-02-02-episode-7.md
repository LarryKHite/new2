summary: "When Facebook opened to the public in 2006, companies scrambled to make profiles, which later became pages. Brands knew that this platform was a then cutting-edge way to reach their customers — a way to fish where the fish were. Over time, though, Facebook has become less of an idyllic fishing sanctuary. Facebook can still deliver results for certain companies, especially paid campaigns for ecommerce. But if you're talking B2B, forget it. Most marketers today know this kind of site targeting just isn't worth the effort, as the business prospects you really want to reach are not looking for your business on Facebook. The real action is on LinkedIn, which has somewhat quietly become a huge marketing platform with unparalleled targeting functionality."
