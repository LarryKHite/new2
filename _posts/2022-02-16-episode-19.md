You’ve spent all this time making sure that you deliver the greatest thing out there, but when you release it to the world, people barely pay it any attention. That can not only be frustrating and confusing, but it can also make you believe that nobody wants what you have to offer — which is not true. It can look like people aren’t interested for a variety of reasons: They simply screenshotted your offer and saved it for when they are able to buy, or maybe they only made a mental note of your offer, got sidetracked and forgot."
