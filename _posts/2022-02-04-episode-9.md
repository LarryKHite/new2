But longevity has become a unifying catalyst of entrepreneurial innovation. Big players in tech have entered the space — from Altos Labs and Google’s Calico to the decentralized crypto crowd including Balaji Srinivasan (former CTO of Coinbase). Defeating death is more than a high-tech fantasy. Philosophers, doctors and artists have been fighting mortality for millenia. As Silicon Valley takes up their quest, what can we learn from those who’ve come before us?"
