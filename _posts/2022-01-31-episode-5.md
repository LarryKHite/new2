summary: "Entrepreneurs’ jobs, goals and strategies will be different every quarter, if not day. You’re aiming to create or accomplish something that’s never been done. You’re going through growing pains and looking to reinvent yourself and your company to ensure you’re delivering a solution with unbeatable, undeniable competitive value. This might sound intuitive, but successful entrepreneurs are the ones who embrace failures, surround themselves with great mentors and take responsibility on every level. Successful entrepreneurs are agile and open to reinventing and adapting. They must be coachable. They’re able to maintain balance for long-term growth and stability. They set boundaries with themselves to not become too affected or disappointed by the highs — like successful fundraising — or the lows — like losing a vital customer. If you get too drilled down with problems and allow the lows to hit you hard, you’ll undoubtedly miss out on opportunities to expand your vision."
