summary: "Parenting is the most important job in the world, and it happens to teach the most valuable entrepreneurial skills. Throughout most of our job-seeking lives, we are required to demonstrate our skills as a precursor to employment. Our resumes list our previous companies and associated roles as evidence of our experience. Job interviews consist of recalling examples when we demonstrated our capabilities—everything must have been recorded in measurable successes, lest we have no proof of our accomplishments."
